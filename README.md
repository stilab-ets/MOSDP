# MOSDP replication package
Replication package for the paper "Learning Software Defect Prediction Models Using Multi-Objective Genetic Programming"

We provide the necessary data to replicate validation results in our study : 

  1- [Original datasets.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/tree/main/original%20datasets)<br />
  2- [The code for MOSDP.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/tree/main/MOSDP%20implementation)<br />
  3- [The code of the studied state-of-the-art approaches.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/tree/main/benchmarks)<br />
  4- [All the results for the validation data.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/blob/main/all%20algorithms%20results.csv)<br />
  5- [Example of obtained rules.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/tree/main/rules%20examples)<br />
  6- [Utility scripts for statistical testing.](https://github.com/stilab-ets/MOSDP/tree/main/utility%20scripts)
