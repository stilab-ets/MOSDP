# How to run MOPSON 

First, it is recommended to create a conda environment using the requirements.txt file via this command
```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

Open the MOPSON.ipynb file and edit the global variables to set the data and the results path. 

Run all the code cells and the code will start executing. 

Once the code finishes running, it will save all the learned models in the results folder. 

To generate the results, please run all the cells from the prepare_MOPSON_results.ipynb notebook.
