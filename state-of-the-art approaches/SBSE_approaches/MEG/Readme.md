# How to Run MEG 

In this study, we implemented a version of MEG using Python which is 3x faster than the original Java-based implementation (PyMEG.ipynb).
The MOEA-DP.jar is used as a sanity check for our implementation. 

Before running MEG, please install the required packages in the requirements.txt

Open the PyMEG.ipynb

Edit the global variables to indicate the path of the data, the features, and the target variables

Run all the cells. 

When the code finishes running, the results will be saved in a CSV file.
