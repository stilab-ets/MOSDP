## How to run the ML scripts
This script is used to run the standard ML benchmarks: Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB). 
Before running the ML script, make sure that you installed the requirements in the requirements.txt file via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Open the notebook file, edit global variables for the data path, and run all cells. 
When the script finishes it will save all the results in an Excel file named "final_results.xlsx"
